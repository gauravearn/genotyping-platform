# genotyping-platform

This repository contains a custom function which can be used to prepare the files for the genotyping or the sequencing. You can specify the path and the fasta files and mark them according to the desired condition for the genotyping or sequencing. I integrated this in a Django based workflow which is available soon in this git respository and can be used to mark the sequencing platform based on the typing annotations.
